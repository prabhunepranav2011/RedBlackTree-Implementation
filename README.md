# RedBlackTree-Implementation
every node is red or black,
the root node is black,
no two red nodes appear consecutively,
and, finally, the path from the root node to all four null leaf nodes passes through two black nodes (either 2 and then 1 , or 2 and then 3 ) on the way to the null leaves
Complexity O(logN)
